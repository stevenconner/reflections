What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a new git repository when you initialize it. You need to do it to get git started otherwise it doesn't do anything.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a go between for the repository and the working directory. It gives you more control over when you commit and what you commit to the repository.
