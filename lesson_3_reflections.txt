When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you want to be able to work on it from multiple computers, or when you want to collaborate with others on the project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you might want to create a new branch for the version that you're working on with that particular computer.
